:::note

Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed is not Camunda Platform 7. If you are looking for Camunda Platform 7 documentation, [click here](https://docs.camunda.org).

However, Optimize documentation is available for both Camunda Platform 8 and Camunda Platform 7, including deployment instructions available [here]($optimize$/self-managed/optimize-deployment/install-and-start). Look for "Camunda Platform 7" badges to help you understand what content is available for what product.

As an alternative to using Camunda Platform 8 through SaaS, you can host it yourself; we call this setup Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed.

Building process automation solutions with Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed is similar to working with Camunda Platform 8 SaaS. For more information on Camunda Platform 8 SaaS, check out [What is Camunda Platform 8?](../components/concepts/what-is-camunda-platform-8.md) If you are new to Camunda Platform 8, we recommend you start your journey with [Camunda Platform 8 SaaS-based guides](../../guides/).
