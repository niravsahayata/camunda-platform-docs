description: "Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed combined and separated Ingress setup"
---

Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed has multiple web applications and gRPC services. Both can be accessed externally using Ingress. There are two ways to do this:

1. **Combined setup:** In this setup, there are two Ingress objects: one Ingress object for all Camunda Platform 8 web applications using a single domain. Each application has a sub-path e.g. `camunda.example.com/operate`, and `camunda.example.com/optimize` and another Ingress which uses gRPC protocol for Zeebe Gateway e.g. `zeebe.camunda.example.com`.
2. **Separated setup:** In this setup, each component has its own Ingress/host e.g. `operate.camunda.example.com`, `optimize.camunda.example.com`, `zeebe.camunda.example.com`, etc.

There are no significant differences between the two setups. Rather, they both offer flexibility for different workflows.

:::note
Camunda Platform 8 Helm chart doesn't manage or deploy Ingress controllers, it only deploys Ingress objects. Hence, this Ingress setup will not work without Ingress controller running in your cluster.
:::

## Preparation

- An Ingress controller should be deployed in advance. The examples below use `Nginx` Ingress controller, but any Ingress controller could be used by setting `ingress.className`.
- TLS configuration is not handled in the examples because it varies between different workflows. It could be configured directly using `ingress.tls` options or via an external tool like [Cert-Manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) using `ingress.annotations`. For more details, check available [configuration options](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/tree/main/charts/camunda-platform#configuration).

## Combined Ingress setup

In this setup, a single Ingress/domain is used to access Camunda Platform 8 web applications, and another for Zeebe Gateway. By default, all web applications use `/` as a base, so we just need to set the context path, Ingress configuration, and authentication redirect URLs.

```

:::note Web Modeler
The configuration above only contains the Ingress-related values under `webModeler`. Note the additional [installation instructions and configuration hints](../../helm-kubernetes/deploy.md#installing-web-modeler).
:::

Using the custom values file, [deploy Camunda Platform 8 as usual](../../helm-kubernetes/deploy.md):

```shell
helm install demo camunda/camunda-platform -f values-combined-ingress.yaml
```

Once deployed, you can access the Camunda Platform 8 components on:

- **Web applications:** `https://camunda.example.com/[identity|operate|optimize|tasklist|modeler]`
  - _Note_: Web Modeler also exposes a WebSocket endpoint on `https://camunda.example.com/modeler-ws`. This is only used by the application itself and not supposed to be accessed by users directly.
- **Keycloak authentication:** `https://camunda.example.com/auth`
- **Zeebe Gateway:** `grpc://zeebe.camunda.example.com`

## Separated Ingress setup

In this setup, each Camunda Platform 8 component has its own Ingress/domain. There is no need to set the context since `/` is used as a default base. Here, we just need to set the Ingress configuration and authentication redirect URLs.
