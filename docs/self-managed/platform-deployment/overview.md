This chapter contains information for users who want to deploy and run Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed, typically in your self-controlled cloud (public or private) or even on your own hardware.

## Components

Camunda Platform 8 includes the following components:

- Zeebe Broker and Gateway
- Operate (requiring Elasticsearch)
- Tasklist (requiring Elasticsearch)
- Connectors
- Optimize (requiring Elasticsearch)
- Identity (requiring Keycloak)
- Web Modeler (requiring Identity, Keycloak, and PostgreSQL) [<span class="badge badge--enterprise-only">Enterprise only</span>](../../../reference/licenses/#web-modeler)

All components except Web Modeler are single Java applications.

Depending on your needs, you might not need all the above components to successfully use Camunda Platform 8.

## Supported environments

For details on supported environments (e.g. Java or Elasticsearch versions), see [supported environments](/docs/reference/supported-environments/).

## Deployment options

You have the following options to run the above components in a self-managed fashion:

- [**Helm/Kubernetes**](./helm-kubernetes/overview.md): We strongly recommend using Kubernetes to run Camunda Platform 8 in production. In addition to stock Kubernetes we also officially support variety of providers like Red Hat OpenShift and Amazon EKS. Also using Kubernetes with Minikube or KIND can be an interesting environment to run Camunda Platform 8 locally on developer machines.
- [**Docker**](./docker.md): You can run the provided Docker images of the components, also in production. For your convenience, we provide a Docker Compose configuration to run Camunda Platform 8 on developer machines. Note that the Docker Compose configuration is **not** optimized for production usage, but for local development.
- [**Manual**](./manual.md): You can run the Java applications on a local or virtual machine if it provides a supported Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows you to run Camunda on virtual machines or bare metal and offers a significant amount of flexibility. However, you will need to configure the details for the components to interact correctly yourself. We consider this a last resort. Note that Windows/Mac is **not** supported for production usage of Zeebe.

## Deployment recommendation

As you can see below, we recommend [SaaS](https://camunda.com/get-started) whenever possible, as Camunda does the heavy lifting and provides everything as a service for you. This provides peace of mind and allows you to concentrate on the important work. If SaaS is not an option, we have a strong opinion on how you should install Camunda Platform 8, depending on the goal (production or development).

### Production

For production usage, we highly recommend using a real Kubernetes cluster and our [Helm charts](./helm-kubernetes/deploy.md) if SaaS provided by Camunda is not an option for you.

We support the following deployment options (the sequence expresses preference) for production:

1. [**SaaS**](https://camunda.com/get-started)
2. [**Helm/Kubernetes**](./helm-kubernetes/overview.md) independent of where this is hosted, for example OpenShift, EKS, or GKE.
3. [**Docker**](./docker.md) images together with the [infrastructure as code (IaC) tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) of your choice.
4. [**Manual**](./manual.md) using the [infrastructure as code (IaC) tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) of your choice.

### Development

For development usage, we highly recommend using our [Helm charts on KIND](./helm-kubernetes/guides/local-kubernetes-cluster.md) if SaaS provided by Camunda is not an option for you. Those Helm charts are battle-tested and give you an experience close to production.

We support the following deployment options (the sequence expresses preference) for development:

1. [**SaaS**](https://camunda.com/get-started)
2. [**Helm/Kubernetes**](./helm-kubernetes/overview.md)
   - [Cloud or on-prem cluster](./helm-kubernetes/overview.md#kubernetes-environments) with one of managed offering like EKS, GKE, etc.
   - [Local cluster](./helm-kubernetes/guides/local-kubernetes-cluster.md) with KIND.
3. [**Docker**](./docker.md) including [Docker Compose](./docker.md#docker-compose), which is **only** recommended for development.
4. [**Manual**](./manual.md) as a last resort if you only need the Zeebe broker. We don't recommend setting up the whole toolchain in this fashion.
